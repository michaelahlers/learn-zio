# Learn [ZIO][zio]

A personal sandbox project for getting familiar with ZIO.

## About

[ZIO][zio] is an increasingly popular set of libraries and frameworks, aiming to bring _pragmatic_ benefits of functional programming to the masses, and quickly becoming a whole new ecosystem on the Scala landscape. Having considerable investments in learning and professional contributions built with the [Lightbend][lightbend] stack ([Akka][akka], [Play][play], and [Lagom][lagom]), this project is meant to help expand those horizons into this exciting new space.
